The idea of bringing together the human mind and machine intelligence into picture is by creating a platform integrated with the intelligence of machines which will allow the users to build an interactive website. The system will be powered with a voice-assisted AI and machine intelligence which will keep upgrading its knowledge based on the usersâ€™ interaction with every use.
